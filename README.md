# Cracks-Statistical-Mechanics

The project deals with the statistical mechanics of a cracked film on a rigid substrate. Evans eigenvalue and Transfer Matrix methods are used to evaluate the escape rate at the saddle. This repo is just a collection of working documents for a hobby project. In the (unlikely...) case you find the topic interesting, I would be glad to share more details.
